# Blood Donation Management System

A comprehensive web-based platform designed to facilitate efficient blood donation and distribution using a weighted scoring model for optimal donor-patient matching.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a modern client-server architecture with clean separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: React with Redux for state management
- **Backend**: .NET 8 with ASP.NET MVC framework
- **Database**: MySQL with cloud hosting
- **Authentication**: SHA-256 hashing with salt mechanisms
- **API Design**: RESTful API with repository patterns

## üöÄ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time blood inventory tracking** with visual analytics
- **Multi-tiered role-based access control** for different stakeholders
- **Weighted scoring model** for optimal donor-patient matching
- **Geographic proximity calculation** using Haversine formula
- **Offline functionality** for rural areas with limited connectivity

### User Roles
- **Hospital**: Donor registration, inventory management, blood requests
- **Local Government (Municipality)**: View donation requests and donors
- **Red Cross**: Donor registration and inventory creation
- **Super Admin**: System oversight and user management

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React** - Component-based UI framework
- **Redux** - State management
- **HTML/CSS/Tailwind** - Styling and responsive design
- **Chart.js** - Data visualization and analytics
- **Leaflet.js** - Interactive mapping
- **Toastify** - User notifications

### Backend
- **.NET 8** - Server-side framework
- **ASP.NET MVC** - Web application framework
- **C#** - Primary programming language
- **Repository Pattern** - Data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection** - Service management

### Database
- **MySQL** - Relational database
- **Cloud hosting** - High availability and scalability
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** - Efficient data exchange

## üß† Smart Algorithms

### 1. Blood Donor Ranking Algorithm
Ranks eligible donors using weighted scoring:
- **Proximity Score (50% weight)**: Distance from hospital
- **Recency Score (30% weight)**: Time since last donation (90-365 days)
- **Age Score (20% weight)**: Donor age optimization (18-37 years)

```
Total Score = 0.5 √ó Proximity + 0.3 √ó Recency + 0.2 √ó Age
```

### 2. Blood Request Prioritization Algorithm
Prioritizes requests based on urgency:
- **High Priority**: Accidents, surgery complications (Priority = 1)
- **Medium Priority**: Pregnancy (Priority = 2)
- **Low Priority**: Planned surgery (Priority = 3)

## üìä Performance Metrics

- **94.7% reduction** in average matching time (32 hours ‚Üí 1.7 hours)
- **89% accuracy** in optimal donor matching
- **93% accuracy** for urgent cases
- **Coverage**: 77 districts and 57 local governments

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL Server
